# Portfolio-Prep
Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The requirement and goals of this app were to create an app where users could record their schedule or events that they have and then be able to see these events and receive reminders about them.  This app was designed to help people who may be forgetful of events they have or help better organize a user's schedule by being able to see all their events in one convient place.

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

So the main screens necessary for the app were a sign on screen and the main screen that displayed all the user's events.  Beyond that I needed to create screens that allowed users to add new events along with a settings and about screen.  I tried to keep my design simple and easy to use for the user.  I didn't add to much on to the screen and it was very easy to see events and how to add an event with the click of a button.  

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I tried to approach the coding for this app screen by screen and feature by feature.  I didn't try to work on the entirity of app all at once, instead I would only focus on one screen at a time and one feature within that screen.  That allowed me to systematically go through each screen and code each piece individually until I was finished with every feature on that screen before moving on to the next one.  In the future, I feel using this method of going piece by piece will help me design future apps or future products by working on each feature individually and making sure they work independently before bringing them all together in the end. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

I made sure to go through and test every function incrementally as I built it.  I would keep a close eye on the IDE error log when compiling the code to see if any error popped up while compiling.  This helped in alerting me to small typos that I made throughout the coding process and helped in keeping the code clean and functional.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

When working through the designing of the app, I had lots of grandiose ideas of features to implement within the app.  However, I quickly realized while coding that my skills were not advanced enough to understand how to implement those types of features within the app.  That's why I innovated to keep the app simple and work to develop the code within the abilities I had and knowledge I could figure out for the basis of the app.

In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

My most skillful component I feel was the "Add Event" screen I developed for adding in new events.  I was able to not only create a well designed screen but it also included a calendar widget and had all the necessary components for adding a new event.  It could be improved in the future by adding certain requirements for each field on the screen or ensuring that it was filled out properly before adding the event but I feel for a first attempt at coding it that it is pretty well designed.
